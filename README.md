# NHS England and NHS Improvement IT Standards

IT Standards for NHS England &amp; NHS Improvement. Documented in markdown and managed as code.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to these standards, please raise an Issue in the first instance.

Contributions will be accepted via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR). Direct contributors should create a "topic branch" in this repository, make changes there and then submit a PR to get the changes approved and accepted into the master branch which will always be the "current" published version.

Non-direct contributors should create a fork of this repository, make changes and submit a PR.

## Formatting and Structure

All standards published in this repository will be written in [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

Folders, naming standards, reference numbers and other structural standards are yet to be agreed.

## Tools

To add/amend standards in this repository, see the [Contributing](#contributing) section above.

Devices being used to make amendments will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

Standard development type tools can be used to manage the change process. Many people will have a favourite code editor that supports Markdown such as [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (which is free for all use and available on different platforms). VS Code has a number of [extensions that support management of GitHub repositories](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).

For anyone who wants something more visual than a text editor, [Typora](https://typora.io/) is recommended. Typora provides a visual editor (WYSIWYG) making edits much easier for non-coders.
