# Contributing to our standards

If you would like to contribute to these standards, please raise an Issue in the first instance.

Contributions will be accepted via 
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR). 
Direct contributors should create a "topic branch" in this repository, make changes there and then submit a PR to get the 
changes approved and accepted into the master branch which will always be the "current" published version.

Non-direct contributors should create a fork of this repository, make changes and submit a PR.

Minor changes will be reviewed by the main owners of this repository. Major changes to standards will be reviewed initially 
by the NHS England and NHS Improvement joint Architecture Review Board. Detailed reviews and further discussions may then be 
allocated to subject matter experts as required.
